                                   Helps avoid DAG rebuilds when switching back from a dev fee session.
                                   Example: "etc" for Ethereum Classic, "etc+zil" for Ethereum Classic + Zilliqa mining.
        --extra-dag-epoch          Allocate extra DAG at GPU for specified epoch. Can be useful for dual mining
                                   of coins like Zilliqa (ZIL). (eg: --extra-dag-epoch 0)
                                   Can be set for each GPU separately by using comma separated list of values
                                   (set to -1 for the GPUs that should not allocate the extra DAG).

    -i, --intensity                GPU intensity 8-25 (default: auto).
                                   Controls the GPU workload size, in other words how many nonces the miner is
                                   processing "in one go": N = 2 ^ intensity
        --low-load                 Low load mode (default: 0). 1 - enabled, 0 - disabled.
                                   Reduces the load on the GPUs if possible. Can be set to a comma separated string to enable
                                   the mode for a subset of the GPU list (eg: --low-load 0,0,1,0)
        --dual-algo                Second algorithm to use in dual mining mode.
        --dual-algo-mode           Controls GPU behaviour in dual mining mode (default: a12).
                                   Format: <algo>:<tuning coefficient>
                                   "<algo>" can be one of: "a1" (first algorithm), "a2" (second algorithm), "a12" (both - dual mining)
                                   "<tuning coefficient>" is optional, and can be either
                                         "rXX" ("dual ratio" coefficient set to XX), or
                                         "rXX:lrYY" ("dual ratio" coefficient set to XX, "LHR dual ratio" coefficient set to YY), or
                                         "hXX" (primary algo hashrate percentage XX).
                                   See dual mining guide for more details.
        --profit-per-mh            Estimated profitability of the algorithms in dual mining mode per 1MH of hashrate.
                                   Used for fine-tuning algo1/algo2 proportion, the miner will try to maximise the earnings.
                                   Format: <profit_algo1>:<profit_algo2>.
                                   Example: --profit-per-mh 0.0516:0.0012
        --lhr-tune                 [Ethash, Autolykos2] LHR tuning value that indicates the percentage of the full speed the miner
                                   tries to achieve for LHR cards (default: -1). Range from 10 to 95.
                                   -1 - auto
                                    0 - disabled (use for non-LHR cards)
                                   74 - recommended starting value for most LHR cards in low power mode (see --lhr-low-power)
                                   78 - recommended starting value for most LHR cards
                                   Can be set for each GPU separately, e.g.
                                   "lhr-tune": "0,0,77.5,0" - this will set LHR tuning value to 77.5 for the third GPU.
        --lhr-autotune-mode        [Ethash, Autolykos2] LHR auto-tune mode (default: down). Valid values:
                                   off  - auto-tune is disabled. LHR tune value is fixed during mining, and will not change
                                          no matter how often LHR lock is detected
                                   down - LHR tune value will decrease if the miner detects LHR lock
                                   full - same as "down" but additionally miner will be trying to increase LHR tune
                                          value if it's stable on the current LHR tune level
        --lhr-autotune-step-size   LHR auto-tune step size (default: 0.1).
                                   Indicates by how much LHR tune value is changed by the LHR auto-tuner.
        --lhr-autotune-interval    LHR auto-tune time interval in minutes (default: 5:120).
                                   Format: <interval_up>:<interval_down>.
                                   "<interval_up>" is the period of time in minutes the GPU must be mining without
                                   hitting LHR locks before the miner attempts to increase the LHR tune value.
                                   If the GPU has tripped LHR, LHR tune value will not decrease if the previous LHR lock
                                   was detected more than "<interval_down>" minutes ago.
        --lhr-low-power            [Ethash] Reduces power consumption in LHR mode at a cost of a slightly lower hashrate (default: 0).
                                   1 - enabled, 0 - disabled. Can be set to a comma separated string to enable
                                   the mode for a subset of the GPUs (eg: --lhr-low-power 0,0,1,0)
        --kernel                   [Ethash] Choose CUDA kernel (default: 0). Range from 0 to 5.
                                   Set to 0 to enable auto-tuning: the miner will benchmark each kernel and select the fastest.
                                   Can be set to a comma separated list to apply different values to different cards.
                                   (eg: --kernel 2,1,1,3)
                                   The support for this parameter may later be extended to cover other algorithms.
        --gpu-init-mode            Enables DAG sequential initialization (default: 0).
                                   0 - all GPUs are initialized in parallel
                                   1 - fully sequential initialization, one GPU at a time
                                   2 - two GPUs at a time
                                   etc.
        --dag-build-mode           [Ethash, ProgPOW, Octopus] Controls how DAG is built (default: 0).
                                   0 - auto (miner will choose the most appropriate mode based on the GPU model)
                                   1 - default (suitable for most graphics cards)
                                   2 - recommended for 30xx cards to prevent invalid shares
                                   Can be set to a comma separated list to apply different values to different cards.
                                   (eg: --dag-build-mode 1,1,2,1)
        --dataset-mode             [Autolykos2] Dataset mode. (default: 2). Valid values:
                                   0 - auto (defaults to 2)
                                   1 - single (each ERGO block the GPU stops hashing until it generates the dataset)
                                   2 - double (the miner generates the dataset for the next ERGO block before it arrives
                                       with a small penalty to reported hashrate, and when the next block does arrive, it
                                       immediately starts hashing without losing 1-4 seconds on creating the dataset).
                                       Memory requirements are doubled in this mode as the GPU has to hold two memory buffers.
                                       If there is not enough memory on the GPU for two datasets, the miner will fall back
                                       to single buffer mode.
        --keep-gpu-busy            Continue mining even in case of pool connection loss.
                                   Useful when a GPU crashes during start/stop cycle that occurs when internet
                                   connection goes down.

    -------------------- GPU fine tuning (Windows & Linux) ------------------

        --pl                       Sets GPU power limit (Windows - in percent, Linux - in Watts)
                                   Requires running the miner with administrative privileges.
        --lock-cclock              Specifies desired locked GPU core clock speed in MHz. (default: 0 - disabled).
                                   Requires running the miner with administrative privileges.
                                   Example: --lock-cclock 1000 (applies clock 1000Mhz to all cards that support this functionality)
                                            --lock-cclock 1000,1300,0 (applies clock 1000Mhz to GPU #0, 1300MHz to GPU #1, ignore GPU #2)

        --mt                       Memory tweak mode (default: 0 - disabled). Range from 0 to 6. General recommendation
                                   is to start with 1, and then increase only if the GPU is stable.
                                   The effect is similar to that of ETHlargementPill.
                                   Supported on Pascal GPUs with GDDR5 or GDDR5X memory only.
                                   Requires running the miner with administrative privileges.
                                   Can be set to a comma separated list to apply different values to different cards.
                                   Example: --mt 4 (applies tweak mode #4 to all cards that support this functionality)
                                            --mt 3,3,3,0 (applies tweak mode #3 to all cards except the last one)

    -------------------- GPU fine tuning (Windows only) ---------------------

                                   All options can be set to a comma separated list to apply different values to
                                   different cards. (default value for all options: 0 - not used)
        --fan                      Sets GPU fan speed in percent or target temperature (auto-fan).
                                   Valid formats:
                                      --fan N           (where N is the fan speed)
                                      --fan t:N         (where N is the target core temperature)
                                      --fan t:N[F1-F2]  (same as above, but with the fan speed constrained by [F1%, F2%] range)
                                      --fan tm:N        (where N is the target memory temperature)
                                      --fan tm:N[F1-F2] (same as above, but with the fan speed constrained by [F1%, F2%] range)
                                   Example: --fan 45,t:67,tm:95,t:69[45-100],tm:90[50-95]
                                   which translates to
                                      GPU #0: set fan speed to 45%
                                      GPU #1: maintain GPU core temperature at 67C
                                      GPU #2: maintain GPU memory temperature at 95C
                                      GPU #3: maintain GPU core temperature at 69C
                                              with the fan speed limited to [45%, 100%] range
                                      GPU #4: maintain GPU memory temperature at 90C
                                              with the fan speed limited to [50%, 95%] range
                                   Note: fan speeds are limited to [0%, 100%] range in auto-fan mode by default.
        --cclock                   Sets GPU core clock offset in MHz.
                                   Requires running the miner with administrative privileges.

        --mclock                   Sets GPU memory clock offset in MHz.
                                   Requires running the miner with administrative privileges.
                                   Will be set to 0 on exit and during DAG rebuild.
        --cv                       Sets GPU core voltage in percent. Must be within [0, 100] range.
                                   Use it only in case you know what you are doing!
                                   Requires running the miner with administrative privileges.
        --lock-cv                  Specifies desired GPU core voltage in mV. (default: 0 - disabled).
                                   Requires running the miner with administrative privileges.
